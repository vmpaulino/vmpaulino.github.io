                Hi there! thanks for your visit! This is my presentation page and Its purpose is to be used as an introduction of me as Software Engineer.
                </p>

                            <p class="lead">
                                I’m a seasoned Software Engineer with nearly 15 years of experience 🧠💻 designing, developing, testing, and deploying distributed backend applications—mainly using .NET, Java, and JavaScript tech stacks. My journey has taken me through consultancy 🧳, product development 🚀, R&D 🧪, and enterprise support 🛠️—giving me a well-rounded perspective on software challenges and solutions. Over the years, I’ve worn many hats 🎩 including Software Developer, Senior Developer, Tech Lead, Systems Architect 🏗️, and even Scrum Master 🧭.

Throughout my career, I’ve helped build and mentor high-performing teams 🧑‍🤝‍🧑, led key tech initiatives, and thrived in roles like Engineering Manager, Technical Lead, and Senior Software Engineer. I specialize in bridging the gap between product and engineering teams 🌉, making sure everyone moves toward the same goal 🎯. My experience at Microsoft—where I handled over 200 high-severity cases for the top 500 enterprise customers—sharpened my critical thinking and customer-first approach 🔧💡, significantly boosting satisfaction across the board 🌟.

From Waterfall 🌊 to Agile 🔄, and now BizDevOps 🔧📈, I’ve embraced various methodologies with a focus on software craftsmanship. I’m a proud evangelist of Agile Architecture 🧱, SOLID principles 🧩, TDD ✅, and design patterns (GoF style 🦋), ensuring clean, maintainable, and scalable codebases.

Above all, I love learning 📚, coaching 🗣️, and collaborating 🤝. I believe in lifting others while delivering value—whether that’s through mentoring, code reviews, or simply sharing ideas. I’m currently working as a contractor 🛠️, bringing all this experience to the table to help teams build awesome stuff 🚀.
