                                    Iâ€™m a Software engineer with almost 15 years of experience on designing, developing, testing and deploying backend distributed applications mainly on .NET, Java and javascript technologies stacks to support a variety of different software designs patterns customized to the needs of the client products requirements.
                                    Since the beginning until now I have been working with diferent methodologies and mindsets. From Waterfall to Agile with scrum until more recently working on product development in a BizDevOps team.
                                    The mindset that I put in place every time I face a new challenge is aligned with Agile software development best practices such as Agile Architecture, Software design SOLID principles, GoF design patterns and methodologies that enable good software quality such as TDD. Always available to learn, adapt, help, coach and support the team, sharing knowledge an discuss solutions.
